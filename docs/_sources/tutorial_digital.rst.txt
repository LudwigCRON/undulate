digital tutorial
================

As presented in section 2.2, several file formats are supported. In the current
section, all supported languages are presented for each example.

.. note::

    For the json and jsonml file formats, the `Wavedrom tutorial <https://wavedrom.com/tutorial.html>`_
    can be followed at the exception of steps 7 and 9.

    The seventh step deals with skin, header, and footer. While the skin property
    is under development, the header and footer properties can advantageously be
    replaced with annotations.

    The ninth step concerns the use of programming language to generate signals.
    As one could notice, the javascript language is messy and not intended for 
    string manipulation. Undulate being a python module, one can leverage the
    true power of python to generate the desired signals.
