Textual representations have the benefit of being compatible with git versioning
and diff tools. And while an image conveys a thousand words, it is difficult to 
list changes in a specification of an electronic project when it comes to 
protocols, handshakes, or impact of a digital signal on an analogue IP block.

Undulate is a python module providing waveforms drawing capability from a textual
representation of them. In addition to that, a command-line interface is bound
to the module to render waveforms in any of your projects. Undulate, including
this documentation, is licensed under the MPL-2.0 OR MIT.

.. note::

   Thanks to the supercalifragilisticexpialidocious work and ideas of the
   wavedrom's author, and contributors on which this project is based.

   Undulate is designed to match as closely as possible wavedrom's output, and 
   deviate only in cases which allows greater flexibility and possibilities.
